This is ASTPP, the Asterisk Postpaid billing and account
management program.  The homepage for this software is
found @ www.astpp.org.  It was started shortly after ASTCC
was released and has been under development since.

Credits:
Mark Spencer (mark@digium.com) originally wrote ASTCC.  We
initially reused a lot of code from that software.  ASTPP
has been almost entirely rewritten to clean up copyright 
issues.  The makefile is the only file which has not been
replaced
